        <h2>Chandler Bing's Legacy: A MarTech Adventure</h2>
        <p class="article">
            On Oct 28, 2023, our beloved Matthew Perry passed away. That's striking news for all “Friend’s” fans. Personally, I have watched the show more than 10 times and basically learned my English from it. In the show, Chandler Bing’s job always seems mysterious and hard to understand, which causes Monica and Rachel lost their apartment in Season 4, Episode 12. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So what’ Chandler Bing’s Job? The answer is he was a data scientist. 
            Monica described it as “Statistical analysis and data configuration”. Later in the show, he got promoted to data manager and eventually switched to an entry-level advertising role. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The show ended in 10 seasons, and we have no further information about Chandler Bing’s career afterwards. So, what happen to him after 10 seasons? What does his career path look like? Based on the changing marketing industry, this might be what happened.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the 90s, digital marketing started to boom, it allowed businesses to target customers digitally by promoting, tracking their behaviors and preferences, and providing the products they might be interested in. Based on the data collected, businesses can predict their products needs based on their behaviors and correctly target the potential customer with their advertisement. A famous example is accurately predicting teen girl pregnancy before her parents notice it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So why is this related to Chandler Bing? That’s because he decided to join an advertising agency for his next career path. He believes he has a “gift” for creating content with humor and jokes, such as “Pants. Like shorts but longer.” Or “Cheese. It’s milk but you chew.” It makes him a perfect person to manage content and promotion in the MarTech industry. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Marketing Technology, a.k.a. MarTech, is a concept of digital marketing that allows technology to track potential or targeted customers more accurately, later turning into a marketing ecosystem. This technique is becoming more and more interchangeable in our day-to-day life. Compared to traditional marketing tactics, such as billboarding, direct mail, print advertisements, digital marketing has its unique advantage. For example, a billboard is able to increase brand awareness for everybody who drives past it. However, people who saw the billboard may or may not be the business's target customer. Meanwhile, digital marketing allows businesses to target the group of people who are more likely to buy their products. This method makes the business more likely to expose their products to the most likely buyers while minimizing costs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, there is more than just content creating. Tagging, activity tracking, bounce rate, click rate, CPC (cost per click), etc., all need marketing staff to have a certain level of data analysis knowledge to solve more and more challenging real-life problems. For Chandler Bing, his new job responsibilities change during the stages of a campaign:
            <ul>
                <li>Before campaign launch: the data team will start researching what the current market looks like, potential in the target market, as well as the target audience and goals. During the market research stage, the data team will have a basic understanding of who the customers to focus on are, as well as the expectations for the conversion. </li>
                <li>During the campaign: working with the project management team to monitor campaign data, making necessary suggestions based on customer behaviors, collecting keywords of interest, and studying the customer journey.</li>
                <li>After the campaign: it usually involves customer satisfaction surveys after finishing the purchase. In some situations, the brand has already set up a loyalty program, as well as having a community set up to build a branded ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            As we remember Matthew Perry, our favorite Chandler Bing, it's like reliving those classic "Friends" moments. Imagining Chandler in the ever-changing world of MarTech brings a smile. After all, his journey from statistical whiz to a master of humor in advertising is oddly fitting. Just like in real life, where careers take unexpected turns, Chandler's story mirrors the fun mix of creativity and tech in MarTech.
